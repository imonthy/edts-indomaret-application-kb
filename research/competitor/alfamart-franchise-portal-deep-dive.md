Alfamart offers **three distinct franchise models**:

### Model 1: New Store (Gerai Baru)

- Alfamart handles all setup after approval

### Model 2: Conversion (Gerai Baru -- Konversi)

## 13. Identified Gaps & Weaknesses (Opportunities for Indomaret)

1. **Registration portal instability:** waralaba.alfamart.co.id/daftar showed "Maintenance :(" during research; alfamartku.com timed out -- infrastructure reliability issues
2. **No visible self-registration on login page:** Missing "Create Account" or "Forgot Password" links on the login page is a UX gap

5. **No document upload portal:** Beyond initial floor plan/photo attachment, no sophisticated document management system visible
6. **No online payment integration:** No evidence of franchise fee payment, deposit, or any financial transaction capability online
7. **Fragmented digital ecosystem:** Main portal (waralaba.alfamart.co.id), registration site (alfamartku.com), app (ALFA Franchise) -- three separate systems with unclear integration
8. **Limited FAQ:** Only 4 questions -- not comprehensive for prospective franchisees
9. **Outdated content signals:** Copyright footer says 2020; latest article from October 2024
10. **No chatbot or live support:** No evidence of real-time customer support on the portal
11. **PDF prospectus not web-accessible:** Franchise prospectus exists as PDF but is not rendered as readable web content
12. **No financial calculator or ROI simulator:** Despite detailed cost structures, no interactive tools for prospects
