## 6. OXXO / FEMSA (Mexico / Latin America)

### Overview

OXXO is Latin America's **largest convenience store network** with **23,500+ stores**, operated by FEMSA (Fomento Economico Mexicano). OXXO is **NOT a franchise** -- it operates as a **company-owned and company-operated** chain. However, its operator model and digital transformation strategies are highly relevant as a benchmark.

FEMSA plans to invest MX$58.8 billion in 2025 (15% increase over 2024), with MX$18.1 billion dedicated to the Proximity Americas division.

### Operator Model (Not Franchise)

Unlike the franchise chains above, OXXO uses a **centralized operator model**:
- All stores are company-owned
- Store managers are employees, not independent franchisees
- Centralized operating system connects all regions and stores
- Economies of scale through coordinated resources
- Knowledge sharing distributed throughout the organization

**Store Management System:**
- OXXO operates a centralized Store Management System (accessible at mys2.oxxo.com.tr for Turkey operations)
- Centralized ordering, inventory, and reporting

### Digital Ecosystem

OXXO/FEMSA has built one of the most sophisticated digital ecosystems in convenience retail:

**Spin by OXXO (Digital Financial Services):**
- **9.9 million active users** (20.5% YoY growth)
- Authorized by Mexico's CNBV as an electronic payment institution
- Digital wallet and payments platform
- Integrated with store operations

**OXXO Premia (Loyalty Program):**
- First brand loyalty program rewarding day-to-day spending
- Digital-first approach via mobile app
- Integrated with Spin for payments

**AI-Driven Supply Chain (RELEX Solutions):**
- Implemented RELEX AI-driven forecasting and replenishment
- Enhanced product demand forecasts across 23,500+ stores
- Integrates with existing operations seamlessly
- Focus on accuracy at individual store level

### Store Technology & Innovation

**Next-Generation Store Design (IDEO Partnership):**
- OXXO partnered with IDEO to redesign the retail experience
- New stores feature:
  - Digital screens and banners for consumer communication
  - **4 self-collection boxes** for faster purchases
  - Technology to simplify and automate customer and staff experiences
  - IoT and telemetry for sustainability and cost optimization

**Digital Transformation Strategy:**
- Internet of Things and intelligent telemetry deployment
- Process robotization for customer service and operational efficiency
- Digitized experiences across the store network
- 2025-2026 restructuring: Spin being aligned closer to OXXO, digital strategy refocused

### Training & Operator Development

- Centralized training programs for store operators (employees)
- Standardized across all 23,500+ locations
- Technology-assisted training with digital tools in-store
- No public documentation of e-learning platform specifics

### Key Takeaway for Indomaret

OXXO demonstrates the power of a **unified digital ecosystem** (payments, loyalty, supply chain AI, IoT) even in a non-franchise model. The lesson: digital tools that tie together the entire operational chain -- from supply chain to customer engagement -- create compounding value. Even for a franchise model like Indomaret, offering franchisees access to an integrated digital ecosystem (rather than siloed tools) is the direction of best practice.

### Top Best Practices to Adopt

#### 1. Mobile-First Application & Management
**Benchmark:** GS25 Bossmon App, Alfamart ALFA Franchise App

Provide franchise applicants and active franchisees with a single mobile application that supports the full lifecycle: from initial application to daily operations management.

#### 2. AI-Powered Recruitment & Onboarding
**Benchmark:** Circle K Europe's NACS Award-Winning Platform

Replace static application forms with AI-enhanced screening (situational judgment tests, predictive analytics). Use gamified onboarding to reduce turnover and accelerate time-to-competency.

#### 3. Electronic Contracts & Digital Document Management
**Benchmark:** GS25 Electronic Contracts, FranConnect Document Repository

Move all franchise agreements, permits, and compliance documents to a digital-first workflow with e-signatures, version control, and automated renewal alerts.

#### 4. Unified Franchisee Support Portal
**Benchmark:** Lawson's Unified Contact System (2022)

Consolidate all franchisee support touchpoints (operations, repairs, systems, HR) into a single portal or contact point, eliminating the need to navigate multiple channels.

#### 5. AIoT for Store Operations
**Benchmark:** GS25 + Scenera MAIstro

Deploy IoT sensors with AI analytics for energy management, predictive maintenance, and in-store incident detection. GS25's 10% electricity savings and KRW 12B cost reduction demonstrate clear ROI.

#### 6. Integrated Digital Ecosystem
**Benchmark:** OXXO/FEMSA (Spin, Premia, RELEX)

Build or integrate digital services (payments, loyalty, supply chain forecasting) into a unified ecosystem rather than offering siloed tools. This creates compounding network effects.

#### 7. Personalized Learning Paths
**Benchmark:** FranConnect AI-driven Learning, Circle K Gamified Training

Training should be role-specific, performance-adaptive, and delivered mobile-first. Gamification (leaderboards, challenges, badges) significantly improves engagement and knowledge retention.

#### 8. Data-Driven Location Assessment
**Benchmark:** Alfamart's 5-factor evaluation, OXXO's store-level optimization

Use data analytics (population density, purchasing power, traffic, competition, facilities) to evaluate franchise locations digitally, reducing reliance on manual surveys.
