### Key Insights for Indomaret Franchise Application Project

1. **Alfamart is the clear benchmark.** They have the most advanced digital franchise application system among Indonesian convenience stores, with a dedicated mobile app (ALFA Franchise) that handles both prospective and active franchisee needs. This is the primary competitor to beat.

2. **Mobile-first approach matters.** Alfamart's ALFA app allows location proposals to be submitted via mobile, giving them a competitive edge. The Indomaret franchise application should at minimum match this capability.

3. **Location proposal is the critical first step.** Across all brands, the initial location proposal/evaluation is the most important gate in the process. Digital tools that streamline location submission (photos, floor plans, GPS coordinates) are common in more mature systems.

4. **Document collection is a major pain point.** Indonesian franchises (both Alfamart and Indomaret) require extensive documentation (NIB, NPWP, STPW, IUTM, IMB, etc.). A system that helps applicants track and upload these documents would be a significant improvement.

5. **Financial transparency builds trust.** 7-Eleven and Circle K provide detailed cost breakdowns and FDD documents upfront. More mature systems offer financial projections as part of the application review, which Alfamart already does in their proposal stage.

6. **Separate portals for new vs. existing franchisees.** 7-Eleven distinguishes between new and existing franchisee flows. This is a good UX pattern to consider.

7. **Post-application engagement.** Alfamart's ALFA app serves both prospective and active franchisees (financial reports, outlet updates). Building a single platform that covers the full lifecycle (application through operations) increases stickiness and reduces tool fragmentation.

8. **The 4-step process is standard.** Most brands follow a similar pattern: Application/Registration -> Evaluation/Feasibility -> Agreement -> Opening. The differentiation is in how digital and streamlined each step is.
