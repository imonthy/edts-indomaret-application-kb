1. **Salesforce CRM as the Application Backbone:** Using Salesforce Experience Cloud with TruPresence provides a unified platform for lead capture, automated credit checks, Twilio-integrated communication, and franchisee self-service portals. This is a best-in-class approach for franchise application management.

2. **Automated Pre-Qualification:** Credit checks and background screening are integrated into the CRM workflow, reducing manual effort and speeding up the screening process.

3. **Separate Flows for New vs. Existing Franchisees:** The portal provides distinct pathways (new-franchisee vs. existing-franchisee), recognizing that existing franchisees expanding their portfolio have different needs and should not repeat basic qualification steps.

4. **Franchises-for-Sale Marketplace:** The portal includes a browse-able listing of available store locations, allowing prospective franchisees to self-select opportunities before even completing a full application.

5. **Integrated Training Ecosystem:** The combination of in-person C.O.O.L. training + the 7University mobile LMS (Schoox) creates a blended learning approach that covers initial onboarding through ongoing compliance.

6. **Real-Time Operational Data:** The RISE system with hourly (sometimes minute-by-minute) updates gives franchisees unprecedented visibility into their operations, reducing dependency on corporate reporting cycles.

7. **Feedback Loop:** 7-Eleven actively seeks franchisee feedback and adapts strategies based on real-world experience, creating a community of entrepreneurs who share best practices.

8. **Market-Specific Adaptation:** Each market adapts the digital model to local realities:
   - USA: Full Salesforce CRM + automated screening
   - Japan: Proprietary GOT terminal + Fujitsu distribution systems
   - Philippines: Google Meet virtual briefings
   - Denmark: Gamified Learningbank training
   - Thailand: Emphasis on small entrepreneur enablement

9. **Veteran-Friendly Programs:** Dedicated discounts and support for military veterans demonstrate inclusive franchise recruitment.

### Cost Comparison (Normalized)

### Key Insights for Indomaret Franchise Application Project

1. **Alfamart is the clear benchmark.** They have the most advanced digital franchise application system among Indonesian convenience stores, with a dedicated mobile app (ALFA Franchise) that handles both prospective and active franchisee needs. This is the primary competitor to beat.

2. **Mobile-first approach matters.** Alfamart's ALFA app allows location proposals to be submitted via mobile, giving them a competitive edge. The Indomaret franchise application should at minimum match this capability.

3. **Location proposal is the critical first step.** Across all brands, the initial location proposal/evaluation is the most important gate in the process. Digital tools that streamline location submission (photos, floor plans, GPS coordinates) are common in more mature systems.

4. **Document collection is a major pain point.** Indonesian franchises (both Alfamart and Indomaret) require extensive documentation (NIB, NPWP, STPW, IUTM, IMB, etc.). A system that helps applicants track and upload these documents would be a significant improvement.

5. **Financial transparency builds trust.** 7-Eleven and Circle K provide detailed cost breakdowns and FDD documents upfront. More mature systems offer financial projections as part of the application review, which Alfamart already does in their proposal stage.

6. **Separate portals for new vs. existing franchisees.** 7-Eleven distinguishes between new and existing franchisee flows. This is a good UX pattern to consider.

7. **Post-application engagement.** Alfamart's ALFA app serves both prospective and active franchisees (financial reports, outlet updates). Building a single platform that covers the full lifecycle (application through operations) increases stickiness and reduces tool fragmentation.

8. **The 4-step process is standard.** Most brands follow a similar pattern: Application/Registration -> Evaluation/Feasibility -> Agreement -> Opening. The differentiation is in how digital and streamlined each step is.
